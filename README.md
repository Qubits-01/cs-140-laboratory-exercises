# xv6 OS Hacking and Configuration

Welcome to my personal GitHub repository, where I document my learning journey as I explore, hack, tinker, and configure the xv6 operating system in various ways. This project serves as a record of my progress and the knowledge I've gained while delving into the intricate world of operating systems.

## What is xv6?

[xv6](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2012/xv6.html) is a simple, educational operating system developed at MIT as a reimplementation of the Unix Version 6 (v6) operating system. It serves as a minimal and understandable platform for learning the fundamentals of operating systems and system programming. xv6 is written in C and x86 assembly, making it an excellent environment for hands-on learning.

## Getting Started

To begin your journey with xv6, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning this repository to your local machine.

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/xv6-hacking.git
   ```

2. **Run xv6**: Build and launch the xv6 operating system in the QEMU emulator.

   ```shell
   make qemu-nox
   ```

3. **Explore & Tinker**: Begin exploring the source code and experiment with the OS. The code is well-commented and organized, making it a great resource for learning.

## My Journey

My journey with xv6 OS is a personal exploration of the following aspects:

### 1. Getting Started

My first step was to set up the xv6 environment. I cloned the xv6 repository, built the image, and ran it in the QEMU emulator. This was my introduction to the xv6 operating system and its basic structure.

### 2. Source Code Exploration

I started exploring the source code to understand how a real operating system is structured. The codebase is well-commented, making it a valuable resource for learning. I delved into various components such as processes, file systems, and memory management.

### 3. Hacking and Experimentation

As I became more comfortable with the codebase, I began experimenting and hacking. I created custom system calls, modified existing ones, and developed new features within the operating system. This allowed me to gain practical insights into system programming.

### 4. Configuration and Customization

I tried different configurations to tailor xv6 to my needs. I explored ways to optimize system performance, modify scheduling policies, and add or remove system components. This process helped me grasp how to adapt an OS to specific requirements.

### 5. Documentation and Sharing

Throughout my journey, I maintained documentation to capture my learnings, challenges, and achievements. I believe in the importance of sharing knowledge, so I created this repository to document and share my experience with others who are on a similar path.

## Project Structure

Each laboratory exercise corresponds to a general topic that encapsulates the features of xv6.
